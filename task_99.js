console.log(+[42,3]);



/*
JavaScript Unary Plus and Array Coercion

1. What is this code?
   - Applies the unary plus (+) operator to an array `[42, 3]`
   - Logs the result to the console

2. Output:
   NaN

3. Why:
   - Unary plus tries to convert the array `[42, 3]` into a number
   - Conversion steps:
     - `[42, 3].toString()` → "42,3"
     - Unary plus: +"42,3" → NaN (because "42,3" is not a valid numeric string)
   - Therefore, the final result is NaN (Not a Number)

4. Key Takeaways:
   - Arrays with more than one element become comma-separated strings when coerced
   - Strings like "42,3" are invalid for numeric conversion
   - Always check what string a structure becomes before applying numeric coercion
